# üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES üö®

## ‚õî ABSOLUTELY NO HARDCODED GAME DATA ‚õî

### ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

**NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, HARDCODE GAME DATA**

This means:
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded team names
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded game IDs  
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded scores
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded dates
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded file names
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded game results for testing
- ‚ùå NO "example" data in code comments
- ‚ùå NO sample team names in variable examples

### ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

**ALL DATA MUST BE DYNAMIC AND SOURCED FROM JSON FILES**

1. **For Testing**: Use actual data from `data/*.json` files
2. **For Team Matching**: Parse team names from score data dynamically
3. **For Game Discovery**: Use the manifest.json system
4. **For Debugging**: Log actual game data, don't make up examples

### üî• ENFORCEMENT

**ANY CODE THAT CONTAINS HARDCODED GAME DATA WILL BE REJECTED**

Examples of BANNED code patterns:
```javascript
// ‚ùå BANNED - Hardcoded team names
if (team === 'Tennessee' || team === 'Georgia') {...}

// ‚ùå BANNED - Hardcoded game results  
const testScore = { home: 44, away: 41 };

// ‚ùå BANNED - Hardcoded file references
const gameFiles = ['game-penn-state.json', 'game-georgia.json'];

// ‚ùå BANNED - Sample data in comments
// Example: "Villanova +48.5" should win because...
```

### ‚úÖ APPROVED code patterns:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ APPROVED - Dynamic team matching
const homeTeam = gameScore.home_team?.name?.toLowerCase();
const awayTeam = gameScore.away_team?.name?.toLowerCase();

// ‚úÖ APPROVED - Dynamic file discovery
const manifest = await fetch('data/manifest.json');
const files = await manifest.json();

// ‚úÖ APPROVED - Using actual game data
console.log(`Testing with actual game: ${gameData.game_meta.title}`);
```

## üìã TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### For Bet Evaluation Testing:
1. Load actual game files from `data/game-*.json`
2. Use real score data from `data/scores.json`
3. Test with actual bet picks from the JSON files
4. Log the actual team names and scores found in the data

### For Debugging:
1. Always reference actual file contents
2. Use `console.log()` to show real data structures
3. Test against multiple real games, not fictional examples
4. Verify results using actual game outcomes

## üéØ THE GOAL

**COMPLETE DYNAMIC FUNCTIONALITY**

Every piece of game data must flow from the JSON files. The application should work with ANY college football data without requiring code changes.

## üíÄ CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATIONS

Code containing hardcoded game data will be:
1. Immediately rejected
2. Require complete rewrite
3. Subject to public shame and ridicule
4. Cause extreme developer frustration

## Contributing Guidelines

### Pull Request Requirements

All PRs must include a signed statement:

```
I certify that this code contains ZERO hardcoded game data and uses only 
dynamic data sourced from JSON files. I have tested this code with actual 
game data from the data/ directory.

Signed: [Your Name]
```

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded team names anywhere
- [ ] No hardcoded scores or game results  
- [ ] No hardcoded file names or game IDs
- [ ] All team matching is dynamic from score data
- [ ] All testing uses real data from JSON files
- [ ] Console logs show actual data, not examples

### Testing Standards

**ONLY test with real data:**
- Load from `data/scores.json` for game scores
- Load from `data/game-*.json` for bet data
- Use `data/manifest.json` for file discovery
- Test against actual completed games

**NEVER create fictional test data**

### Banned Patterns

Any PR containing these patterns will be auto-rejected:

```javascript
// ‚ùå These will get your PR rejected immediately
const teams = ['Alabama', 'Georgia', 'Tennessee'];
if (teamName === 'Penn State') { ... }
const mockGame = { home: 'UGA', away: 'TENN', score: [44, 41] };
// Testing with Villanova +48.5...
```

### Approved Patterns

```javascript
// ‚úÖ These are the ONLY acceptable patterns
const homeTeam = gameScore.home_team?.name;
const awayTeam = gameScore.away_team?.name;
const actualBet = gameData.picks?.best_bet?.pick;
console.log(`Testing actual bet: ${actualBet} with score ${homeScore}-${awayScore}`);
```

**REMEMBER: If it's not in the JSON, it doesn't exist. Period.**

**Failure to follow these rules will result in immediate PR closure and public developer shaming.**
